# Simple-ADExplorer / BofHound Viewer

A web-based viewer for [bofhound](https://github.com/fortalice/bofhound) Active Directory log files.  
Upload a `.log` file collected from a domain environment, then search, filter and inspect every AD object it contains — all in a local dark-mode interface backed by SQLite.

---

## Features

- **Upload & parse** bofhound `.log` files and SysInternals ADExplorer `.adsnapshot` files (drag-and-drop or file picker); snapshots are converted automatically via [ADExplorerSnapshot](https://github.com/c3c/ADExplorerSnapshot)
- **SQLite storage** — logs are persisted between sessions; switch between multiple uploads
- **Object table** with sortable columns: name / SAM account, object type, account status, description, last logon, password age, last changed
  - Click any column header to sort ascending / descending; active column is highlighted with a ↑ / ↓ indicator
  - Description is truncated in the table; full text appears on hover
- **Sidebar filters**
  - Object type (user, computer, group, OU, GPO, schema objects, …) with object counts
  - Last logon — preset buttons (30 d / 90 d / 6 m / 1 y) or custom date
  - Password last set — same presets / custom date
  - Object last changed — same presets / custom date
  - Admin accounts only toggle
  - Full-text search across all fields
- **Detail panel** — click any row to see every attribute grouped by category, with:
  - Timestamps decoded from Windows FILETIME and LDAP Generalized Time to human-readable dates + relative age
  - `userAccountControl` decoded to readable flag badges (Enabled / Disabled / Locked / No Pwd Expiry / …)
  - Long binary fields (e.g. `nTSecurityDescriptor`) collapsed by default with an expand toggle
  - **DN navigation** — any Distinguished Name value is a clickable link that opens the referenced object directly in the detail panel; a **← Back** button lets you retrace your path (e.g. open a group → click a `member` DN → navigate to that user)
- **Multiple log support** — upload logs from several DCs and switch between them via the top bar

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later
- Pip / venv

---

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone ssh://forgejo@forgejo.nm1ss.net/Nm1ss/Simple-ADExplorer.git
cd Simple-ADExplorer

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the application

```bash
python app.py
```

The server starts on **http://localhost:5000** in debug mode.

For a production deployment (optional):

```bash
pip install gunicorn          # Linux / macOS
gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app

# Windows (waitress)
pip install waitress
waitress-serve --port=5000 app:app
```

> **Note:** The application is intended for local/internal use only.  
> Do not expose it to an untrusted network — log files may contain sensitive AD data.

---

## Docker

### Build the image

```bash
make release
# or with a custom version tag
make release VERSION=1.0.0
```

### Run with `docker run`

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v adexplorer-instance:/app/instance \
  -v adexplorer-uploads:/app/uploads \
  --name adexplorer \
  simple-adexplorer:latest
```

Named volumes keep the SQLite database and uploaded log files alive across container restarts and upgrades, while always starting empty on first use.

### Run with Docker Compose

A ready-made `docker-compose.yml` is included:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop without losing data:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop **and wipe all data** (volumes included):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

The compose file uses named volumes and sets `restart: unless-stopped` so the container starts automatically after a reboot.

## Usage

1. Open **http://localhost:5000** in your browser.
2. Click **Upload Log** in the top-right corner.
3. Drag and drop (or browse to) a bofhound `.log` file and click **Upload**.  
   Parsing a 90 000-line log typically takes a few seconds.
4. Use the **sidebar** to filter by object type, date ranges, or keywords.
5. Click any row in the table to open the **detail panel** with all attributes.
6. Switch between previously uploaded logs with the dropdown in the top bar.

### Example log file format

```
cn: Mike Clelland
distinguishedName: CN=Mike Clelland,OU=3rd Line,...
objectClass: top, person, organizationalPerson, user
sAMAccountName: mclelland
userAccountControl: 66048
pwdLastSet: 134129938822946410
lastLogon: 134266146598383587
whenChanged: 20260616150734.0Z
--------------------
cn: Domain Admins
objectClass: top, group
groupType: -2147483646
member: CN=Mike Clelland,...
--------------------
```

Objects are separated by a line of dashes (`--------------------`).
